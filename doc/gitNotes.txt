List all tags with their comments:

    git tag -n1



Create and tag a release (usually at the end of an event after all changes are
finalized):

    git checkout develop

    git flow release start v3.10

    git flow release finish 'v3.10'
        For both the merge and the tag message, add something like "This is the
        final version from such-and-such event 2021 (SAS_2021)."

    git push
    git push --tags

    git checkout master
    git push
    git push --tags

    git checkout develop
