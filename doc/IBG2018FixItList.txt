Fix-It Items from Idaho Botanical Garden - Winter Garden aGlow 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ]
Bells needs to go active immediately when sound passes the activation threshold
and needs to stay active for some number of ms after sound decreases below
threshold.  Maybe implement histeresis, too.



[ ]
Need to put some foam padding on Rainstick's holder to cushion Rainstick when
people slam it into the holder--sometimes repeatedly.



[X]
Bottom (green sparkle) bell needs to be fixed.  Seems to have an intermittent
connection at the microphone.


[ ]
Middle (red sparkle) bell needs to be fixed.  It jabbers sometimes.  Also, it is
too sensitive, often responding to wind noise.



[ ]
Magnets on all FourPlay-4-x wheels need to be re-glued with epoxy.  Maybe swap
out one wheel at a time with one that has been reworked.



[ ]
String 20 appears to have a bad connection up top.



[ ]
The connections for strings ? and ? are swapped at the top disk.



[ ]
String 41 is flakey about 2/3rds of the way down--intermittent, bad data, possibly due to sustained, heavy rain on 30 Nov.  Power seems ok.



[ ]
String 27 is bad after the 52nd pixel--intermittent, bad data, possibly due to sustained, heavy rain on 30 Nov.  Power seems ok.
