/*******************************************************************************
The Great Google says that sunset at Stargazer Ranch, Utah on Saturday 18 June
is at 9:10 PM and sunrise on Sunday 19 June is at 5:59 AM.  We'll go with that.
The previous is from 2022.  It is now 2023, and an earlier on-time seems more
appropriate because of light and clouds and shit.  So there.
