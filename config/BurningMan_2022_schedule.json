/*******************************************************************************
WillyWeather says that sunset at Black Rock City on Friday, 26 August 2022 is at
7:38 PM PDT, and sunrise the next morning is at 6:19 AM PDT.  By the end of the
event on 5 Sept., sunrise is 9 minutes later, and sunset the nigh before is 16
minutes earlier!  To make sure that Illumicone is always on from sunset to
sunrise, we'll use the earlier sunset and the later sunrise times.  Since we
don't mess with the time zone on widpatcon, we'll use MDT in this config.
