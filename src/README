To setup each Pattern, first create an object of the derived pattern class.
Then call that object's initPattern() and initWidgets() functions to initialize
the Pattern with its Widgets.

On each loop, call each pattern's update() function.  This function iterates
through each Pattern's Widgets, and calls each Widget's moveData() function.
The moveData() function gets the updated position, velocity, etc from each
of its channels.

After the data has been moved, update() updates its own pixelArray values
using the channel's position, velocity, etc.
